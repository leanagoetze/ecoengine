\arguments{
\item{page}{Page number}

\item{state_province}{Need to describe these parameters}

\item{county}{California counties. Package include a full list of counties. To load dataset \code{data(california_counties)}}

\item{genus}{genus name}

\item{scientific_name}{scientific name}

\item{authors}{author name}

\item{remote_id}{remote id}

\item{collection_code}{Type of collection. Can be \code{CalAcademy}, \code{Private}, \code{VTM}, \code{CDFA}. \code{CalFlora} Others TBA}

\item{source}{data source. See \code{\link{ee_sources}}}

\item{min_date}{Lower date bound. Most be in format Y-m-D h:m:s. This package uses lubridate's \code{ymd_hms} function to format dates.}

\item{max_date}{upper date bound. Most be in format Y-m-D h:m:s. This package uses lubridate's \code{ymd_hms} function to format dates.}

\item{related_type}{Need to describe these parameters}

\item{related}{Need to describe these parameters}

\item{page_size}{The number of observations per page returned by the query. The package default is \code{250} observations. The API default, however, is \code{10}. Setting this number higher will require fewer calls (i.e. pages) but a large size may also fail or timeout.}

\item{quiet}{Default is \code{FALSE}. Set to \code{TRUE} to suppress messages.}

\item{georeferenced}{Default is \code{FALSE}. Set to \code{TRUE} to filter by photos that have geo data.}

\item{progress}{Progress bar is set to \code{TRUE} by default. Use \code{FALSE} especially when calling functions inside documents.}

\item{other_catalog_numbers}{Need to describe these parameters}

\item{foptions}{A list of additional arguments for \code{httr}. There is no reason to use this argument except for debugging purposes.}

\examples{
# Request all photos. This request will paginate.
# merced <- ee_photos(county = "Merced County")
 ee_photos(page_size = 10)
# Search by collection code. See notes above on options
# ee_photos(collection_code = "CalAcademy")
# ee_photos(collection_code = "VTM")
# ee_photos(collection_code = "CalFlora")
# ee_photos(collection_code = "CDFA")
# Search by county.
# sc_county <- ee_photos(county = "Santa Clara County")
# merced <- ee_photos(county = "Merced County")
# merced <- ee_photos(county = "Merced County", page = "all")
# The package also contains a full list of counties
data(california_counties)
# alameda <- ee_photos(county = california_counties[1, 1])
# alameda$data
# You can also get all the data for Alameda county with one request
# alameda <- ee_photos(county = "Alameda county", page = "all")
# Spidering through the rest of the counties can easily be automated.
# Or by author
# charles_results <- ee_photos(author = "Charles Webber", page = 1:2)
# You can also request all pages in a single call by using ee_photos()
# In this example below, there are 6 pages of results (52 result items).
# Function will return all at once.
# racoons <- ee_photos(scientific_name = "Procyon lotor", page = "all")
